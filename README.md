**Jenkins Pipeline Setup for GitHub Integration**

This project involves creating a Jenkins pipeline that integrates with GitHub to automate the build, test, and deployment process. 
The pipeline will be triggered by new commits to the GitHub repository with a short delay, 
and will include email notifications with logs attached upon completing test and Security Scan stages.
