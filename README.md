**Jenkins Pipeline Setup for GitHub Integration**

This project involves creating a Jenkins pipeline that integrates with GitHub to automate the build, test, and deployment process. 
The pipeline will be triggered by new commits to the GitHub repository with a short delay, 
and will include email notifications with logs attached upon completing test and Security Scan.

**Pipeline Stages and Tools**

**1.** **Build**
Description:
In this stage, the code is compiled and packaged into deployable artifacts. This ensures that the code is correctly built and ready for testing and deployment.

Tool:
Maven: A build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It handles the projectâ€™s build lifecycle, including compilation, packaging, and dependency management.


**2. Unit and Integration Tests**
Description: 
This stage runs unit tests to validate individual components and integration tests to ensure that different components of the application work together as expected. It verifies the functionality and correctness of the code.

Tool:
JUnit: A widely used testing framework for Java applications. It is often used with Maven to run unit tests.


**3. Code Analysis**
Description:
Code analysis involves examining the codebase to ensure it meets quality standards and adheres to best practices. This helps in identifying potential bugs and maintaining code quality.

Tool:
SonarQube: A popular tool for continuous inspection of code quality. It provides detailed analysis and reporting on code quality, including bugs and vulnerabilities.


**4. Security Scan**
Description: 
A security scan is performed to identify vulnerabilities and security issues within the code. This is crucial to ensure that the application is secure and free from known vulnerabilities.

Tool:
OWASP Dependency-Check: A tool that scans project dependencies for known vulnerabilities. It integrates with Maven and generates reports on potential security issues.


**5. Deploy to Staging**
Description: 
In this stage, the application is deployed to a staging environment that mimics the production environment. This allows for final testing in an environment similar to production before going live.

Tool:
AWS EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud): It is a core component of Amazon Web Services that provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud. It allows you to launch and manage virtual servers, called instances, to run your applications.

**6. Integration Tests on Staging**
Description:
This stage involves running integration tests in the staging environment to verify that the application behaves as expected in a production-like environment. It helps in catching issues that may not be evident in the development environment.

Tool:
Postman: A tool for testing APIs and web services. It can be used to automate integration tests for staging environments.


**7. Deploy to Production**
Description: 
The final stage deploys the application to the production environment. This is where the application becomes available to end-users. It should be done with caution and ideally after successful tests in the staging environment

Tool:
AWS CLI: Used to manage AWS resources and deploy artifacts to an EC2 instance
